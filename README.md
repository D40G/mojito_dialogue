# Mojito Dialogue ðŸ’¬
Simple to use NPC interaction / dialogue system to take a user's input. NPC spawning is optimised and handled by PolyZones.

### Code Examples
There are three ways to access data from an NPC interaction as follows:

With Callback:
```lua
exports['mojito_dialogue']:NewDialogueCallback(`a_m_y_skater_02`, vec3(-727.74, -143.54, 36.36), 20.0, {
    title = "Would you like to start a mission",
    items = {
        {text = "Yes", value="yes"},
        {text = "No", value="no"}
    }
}, function(selection)
    if selection == "yes" then
     QBCore.Functions.Notify("You picked yes", "success")
    else
     QBCore.Functions.Notify("You picked no", "error")
    end
end)
```
The result is returned as a callback function with argument 0 being the selection value in string form.

With Event:
```lua
exports['mojito_dialogue']:NewDialogueEvent(`a_m_y_skater_02`, vec3(-727.74, -143.54, 36.36), 20.0, {
    title = "Would you like to start a mission",
    items = {
        {text = "Yes", value="yes"},
        {text = "No", value="no"}
    }
}, "myscript:client:onInteract")

AddEventHandler("myscript:client:onInteract", function(selection)
    print(selection) -- "yes" or "no" 
end)
```

The result is returned as the first argument to the specified client event

Inline:
```lua
local selection = exports['mojito_dialogue']:NewDialogueSync(`a_m_y_skater_02`, vec3(-727.74, -143.54, 36.36), 20.0, {
    title = "Would you like to start a mission",
    items = {
        {text = "Yes", value="yes"},
        {text = "No", value="no"}
    }
})
```
The result is returned inline from a promise in string form.
